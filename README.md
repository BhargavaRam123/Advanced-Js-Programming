# Advanced JavaScript Programming 

This repository contains comprehensive implementations and practical examples of advanced JavaScript concepts, focusing on object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming patterns, and core language mechanics.

## Core Object-Oriented Programming

### Objects & Classes
Advanced object creation patterns and ES6+ class implementations showcasing encapsulation, abstraction, and modern JavaScript object modeling. Includes practical examples of class declarations, methods, static properties, and constructor patterns for building robust data structures.

### Object References & Copying
In-depth exploration of JavaScript's reference system including shallow vs deep copying techniques, object mutation patterns, and memory reference management. Demonstrates cloning strategies using spread operator, Object.assign(), and custom deep copying algorithms.

### Garbage Collection
Practical implementations demonstrating memory management concepts, reference counting, mark-and-sweep algorithms, and memory leak prevention techniques. Includes examples of proper object lifecycle management and memory optimization strategies.

### Object Methods & Context ("this")
Comprehensive coverage of method definitions, context binding, and "this" keyword behavior in different execution contexts. Demonstrates method borrowing, context preservation, and solving common "this" binding challenges in various scenarios.

### Constructor Functions & "new" Operator
Advanced constructor patterns including function constructors, prototype setup, instance creation workflows, and the internal mechanics of the "new" operator. Covers constructor validation, return value handling, and initialization patterns.

### Optional Chaining ('?.')
Modern JavaScript safety patterns using optional chaining for deep object property access, method invocation, and array element retrieval. Includes practical implementations for handling undefined/null values in complex data structures.

### Object-Primitive Conversions
Detailed implementations of JavaScript's type conversion system including Symbol.toPrimitive, valueOf(), toString() methods, and custom conversion logic for complex objects. Demonstrates type coercion in mathematical operations and string contexts.

### Property Management
Advanced property configuration using Object.defineProperty(), property descriptors (writable, enumerable, configurable), and property attribute manipulation. Includes examples of creating immutable properties and controlling object behavior.

### Getters & Setters
Implementation of computed properties, data validation through setters, and dynamic property access patterns. Demonstrates property interceptors, data binding techniques, and controlled access to object internals.

## Prototype System & Inheritance

### Prototypal Inheritance
Comprehensive exploration of JavaScript's prototype chain, prototype-based inheritance patterns, and object delegation mechanisms. Includes classical inheritance simulation and prototype manipulation techniques.

### Native Prototypes
Advanced manipulation of built-in object prototypes including Array, Object, Function, and String prototypes. Demonstrates safe prototype extension, polyfill creation, and understanding browser compatibility considerations.

### Objects without __proto__
Implementation of prototype-free objects using Object.create(null), exploring use cases for dictionary objects, performance considerations, and avoiding prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

### Class Inheritance Patterns
Modern ES6+ class inheritance using extends keyword, super() calls, method overriding, and complex inheritance hierarchies. Includes mixin patterns and multiple inheritance simulation techniques.

### Extending Built-in Classes
Advanced class extension patterns for native JavaScript classes including Array, Error, and Map extensions. Demonstrates proper subclassing techniques, constructor delegation, and maintaining built-in functionality.

## Asynchronous Programming Mastery

### Promises & Promise Chaining
Comprehensive Promise implementations including creation, chaining patterns, error propagation, and complex asynchronous workflow management. Demonstrates sequential and parallel execution patterns with proper error handling.

### Promise API Advanced Usage
In-depth coverage of Promise.all(), Promise.allSettled(), Promise.race(), Promise.any() with practical implementations for batch processing, timeout handling, and fallback mechanisms in real-world scenarios.

### Error Handling Strategies
Robust error management patterns for asynchronous operations including try-catch blocks, promise rejection handling, and error propagation through promise chains. Includes debugging techniques and error logging strategies.

### Custom Error Classes
Implementation of specialized error types extending the native Error class, including custom error properties, stack trace management, and domain-specific error handling for better debugging and user experience.

### Promisification Techniques
Advanced techniques for converting callback-based APIs to Promise-based interfaces, including utility functions for legacy code integration and creating Promise wrappers for Node.js-style callbacks.

### Async/Await Patterns
Modern asynchronous programming using async/await syntax, including error handling with try-catch, sequential vs parallel execution patterns, and performance optimization techniques for asynchronous operations.

### Async Iteration & Generators
Advanced implementation of async generators, async iterators, and for-await-of loops for handling streams of asynchronous data. Includes practical examples of pagination, data streaming, and lazy evaluation patterns.

## Advanced Programming Concepts
### Hoisting Mechanics
Deep understanding of variable and function hoisting behavior, temporal dead zones, and execution context creation. Includes practical examples demonstrating scope resolution and identifier lookup processes.
